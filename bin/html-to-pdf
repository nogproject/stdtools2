Usage:
  html-to-pdf [--portrait|--landscape] <html> [<pdf>]

Options:
  --portrait    Use portrait orientation (default).
  --landscape   Use landscape orientation.

`stdtools html-to-pdf` converts HTML to PDF.  The HTML source may be a URL.
The default PDF filename is the basename of the HTML source with the extension
replaced by `.pdf`.

`stdtools html-to-pdf` requires `wkhtmltopdf`, which you can install on macOS
with:

    brew cask install wkhtmltopdf

Do not use v0.12.4 on macOS.  It renders PDFs with unexpectedly tiny fonts.
The issue has been fixed in v0.12.5.  See release notes
<https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v0125-unreleased>
and PR-3386 <https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/pull/3386>.
